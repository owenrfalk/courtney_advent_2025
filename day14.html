                Up until this point, I was worried that you were way smarter than me. Like not just better at crosswords, but in a league all on your own where I was playing checkers while you were playing 4D chess. I hadn’t met a person as high horsepower mentally, and I was feeling sad about the fact that I was the dumb one in a couple. This was an early sign that there are things that we both excel at more than the other. This has felt like a superpower as we’ve started a family, because our strengths compliment each other so well. I’m so glad to have you as my partner in crime (i.e. death by bank robbery. I’ll bring the stoke and safe cracking skills, you bring the plan) PS. Sorry I wasn’t as graceful with you here as you were with me when you were crushing me at squash
